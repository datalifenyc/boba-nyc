This project recommends beginner-level proficiency with Python and is focused on applying Python to data analysis.

## Data

### Yelp Fusion API

Note: the Yelp Fusion API is a __free__ API on Yelp's Developer Site. Details from the Yelp Fusion page:

> __Create an app on Yelp's Developers site__
In order to set up your access to Yelp Fusion API, you need to create an app with Yelp. This app represents the application you'll build using our API and includes the credentials you'll need to gain access. Here are the steps for creating an app:  
>
> 1. Go to [Create App](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)  
> 2. In the create new app form, enter information about your app, then agree to Yelp API Terms of Use and Display Requirements. Then click the Submit button.  
> 3. You will now have an API Key.  
>
> __Please keep the API Key ðŸ”‘ to yourself since it is the credential for your call to Yelp's API.__
