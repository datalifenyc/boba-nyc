## Introduction

In this workshop, we explore and develop insights about NYC's Bubble Tea Shops using the Yelp Fusion API. Sections include:

- How to use the Yelp Fusion API
- Data Cleaning, Wrangling and Visualizations in Python
- A demo of our web app created in Jupyter Book and Streamlit.

Additionally, questions weâ€™ll explore include bubble tea locations, Yelp ratings, review counts and price.

After an initial introduction of each section, participants will join break-out groups depending on which topic they would like to learn more about. These break-out sessions will be hands-on and interactive. Participants will then reconvene for a Q&A and final thoughts. Attendees will gain a better understanding of the data analysis workflow and will leave with skills and a template to uncover insights with any dataset.

This workshop recommends beginner-level proficiency with Python and is focused on applying Python to data analysis; however, those new to Python are gladly welcome!

## Prerequisites

- Basics of Python or other programming languages (R, SQL, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of Data Analysis
- Basics of Jupyter Notebooks

This project recommends beginner-level proficiency with Python and is focused on applying Python to data analysis.

## Data

### Yelp Fusion API

Note: the Yelp Fusion API is a __free__ API on Yelp's Developer Site. Details from the Yelp Fusion page:

> __Create an app on Yelp's Developers site__
In order to set up your access to Yelp Fusion API, you need to create an app with Yelp. This app represents the application you'll build using our API and includes the credentials you'll need to gain access. Here are the steps for creating an app:  
>
> 1. Go to [Create App](https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app)  
> 2. In the create new app form, enter information about your app, then agree to Yelp API Terms of Use and Display Requirements. Then click the Submit button.  
> 3. You will now have an API Key.  
>
> __Please keep the API Key ðŸ”‘ to yourself since it is the credential for your call to Yelp's API.__
